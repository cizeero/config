# Config setup
Keeping a repository with instructions to setup Fedora Sway, also a lookup place for me to visit and make changes if required. Will probably feed it to an LLM and ask it to make changes.

## Kanshi
Made a profile for single screen. Will scale it to two screens when I have a monitor

## Foot
Set a default config, changed the text-size to 12

## Sway
Kanshi does not run by default, so I added the config to run Kanshi on Sway init. Copied the sway terminal from `/etc/sway/config` before

## Zsh
Indicate the presence of `zshrc` in the `~/.zshenv` folder and have the `zshrc` in the config folder itself.
